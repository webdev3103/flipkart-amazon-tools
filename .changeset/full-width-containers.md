Implement full-width layouts across all pages by setting Container maxWidth to false

Updated 9 pages to use full-width containers for better space utilization:
- Category Groups page
- Categories page
- Storage Management page
- Products page
- Uncategorized Products page
- Transaction Analytics page
- Home (PDF Merger) page
- Today's Orders page

This change provides a more spacious and modern layout across the application while maintaining mobile responsiveness.
